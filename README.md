# Data Modeling with Postgres 

In this first **Udacity data engineering nanodegree project** we must model a postgres database for a music streaming platform called **Sparkify**. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
