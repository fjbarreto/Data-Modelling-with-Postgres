# Data modeling with Postgres 

In this first **Udacity data engineering nanodegree project** we must create a postgres database schema and an ETL pipeline for a music streaming platform called **Sparkify**. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

# Project Datasets

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.

### **Song Dataset**
````
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
````
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

````
{
"num_songs": 1, 
"artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", 
"artist_latitude": null, 
"artist_longitude": null, 
"artist_location": "", 
"artist_name": "Line Renaud", 
"song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", 
"title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", 
"duration": 152.92036, 
"year": 0
}
````

### **Log Dataset**

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

````
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
````

# Schema design 

For this project a star schema with one **fact** table (songplays) and 4 **dimension** tables (artists, songs, users and time) is used. This schema design will minimize the need for JOIN statements, allowing faster reads of the analytics database.

# Project files

• **sql_queries.py**: python script with CREATE, DROP and INSERT statements needed.

• **create_tables.py**: python script that executes drop and create statements from **sql_queries.py** in our postgres db.

• **etl.py**: python script with user defined functions that extract, transform and loads data into our tables from the JSON files.

# SQL analytics query example

• Top 5 most listened artists:

````
SELECT a.name, COUNT(*) listeners
FROM artists a
JOIN songplays s
ON s.artist_id = a.artist_id
GROUP BY a.name
ORDER BY listeners DESC
LIMIT 5;
````
